Shri Ganeshye Namaha:

Make Spring-starter-Project : 
name:Smart Contact Manager
dependecies: 
          1.spring-boot-dev-tools
          2.spring boot-starter-web
          3.started-thymeleaf
          4.starter-data-jpa
          5.my-sql-connector
          6.starter-security
          7.validation-api
          8.hibernate-validator

Main file has @SpringBootApplication= @Configuration ,@EnableAutoConfiguration , @ComponenentScan



Setup the properties in application.properties.

server.port=8282
spring.datasource.name=smartcontact
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/smartcontact
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL55Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update     //used for automatic making the table      

-> Make the ER diagram from draw.io website.

Video 40:
 
 Make the entities as made in ER diagram.
 - Make user class.(make is @Entity ,@Id,@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO))


- Make a contact class  ,
   

- Set mapping 1 to many
  Declare the List<contact> in User class.(gen getter,setter for it)
  Declare User var in Contact class.(gen getter,setter)

User-mapping:
  @OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL , fetch=FetchType.LAZY)

Contact-mapping:
  @ManyToOne()

Now Make a UserRepository interface and just extends the jpaRepository(User,Integer)

Now create a new User and also save it using save method.

Now when we run project, tables are created . To avoid extra creation of table for Contacts use mappedBy="user"  in   @OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL , fetch=FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy="user")

No need to create seperate table for contacts, manage contact using foreign key "user" only.

Now make A TestController and check whether data is submitted to database or not.

_____________________________________________

Video : 41

Make the Controllers : and design handlers methods to setup the Thymeleaf /html view to show.

Use Inherit Thymeleaf concept : desing a  base.html file and put css/html/js 
and import in other files.
set the xmlns: of Thymeleaf.

In Base.html
Now we take the (content)input as framgent="layout()" and in body section use the replace="${}"  to dynamically put the file here.

So what happen actually , whenever any other html file is called , it call the base.html using th replace tag and put its whole content (generally stored in section tag) inside the body of base.html ;



We can set the common header , footers in base file to show in all files.

eg include the navbar to show in all folders.

** We can make out own css , js , images in static folder.
Include css.file

<link rel="stylesheet" th:href="@{/css/style.css}">

Include js file

Just go to base.html file and include the <script th:src="@{/js/script.js}">

Video 43 :
Design the Sign up form :

__________________________

Video 44:

We send the empty user from handler of signup , and receive it on th:object="${user}" in  <form >  - this is used to show the old data present in user. And we also assign the old values to fields using  th:value="${user.name}"

To remove the green color tick used the from -control  "is valid "


_______________________________

Video 45:  Server Side Validation:

apply 2 dependencies like javax validation , and hibernate-validator 

Then set the server side validations using @Blank , @Email @Size @AssertTrue etc

Also go to Controller, ans use @Valid in handler method argument() and collect result in Bindingresults.


Now invalid feedback is added to show the error in name input field of signup page. BAsically giving red-border on field if error comes.

Now to show this : we sholud dynamically append the  class name as "is-invalid" addition to form control if erros comes.


Keep in Mind that the binding resutl1 should be placed after the Model User 

Do check the checkbox to check server validation of name field

We have make off the by defalult validation of html in <form novalidate> : this is done to test the working @Blank and  @Size , server side validations.

Video 46 : BCryptPasswordEncoder

Making Login System.

dependency of security , remove version  :
Apply spring-starter-security

Making the UserController , to handler requests of user and normal user

Now we are securing the localhost:8282/user/index  

By defalut spring-secutiy protects all url , and give the password on console.

We need to define explicity which url needs to be protected , and take manual passord.


Make the CustomUserDetails  , UserDetailsServiceImp Services classes. respectively.
Make the MyConfig class , extends the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter


___________________________________________

Now designing our own login from  , google login form bootstrap : open bootsnip website and copy the html and paste the inside of body into  section of our login.html file , also copy the css except .body {}  and paste in style.css file of static/css folder.


 Keep in mind the custom form desinged by us should be , have same field name as username and password , as spring-security used it in his default form.

 Go to config ,and make its as permanet login page , 
 put loginPage("/signin")  in configure method.

 Now put th:action="@{/signin}" in <form> tag

 Also show errors when , invalid given .

 Video-50 :

 we can mentions the method to configure the behaviour of Login page

 -- loginPage()
 -- loginProcessingUrl() -to set the redirect view of username and password.

 -- defalutSuccesUrl() ->after successful url.
 -- failureUrl()

Make the from For Contact Form
:

Designing the add-contact form form the user.

*********  All the url are prefixed by the user : so that the other are relative to user

eg : user/index :

***************8

Since we need to use the user in all handlers , so making a common method to assign handler to all.


* Fixing the navbar : apply fixed-top

Beckend code of Add contact From,
To check the working print the Contact object : 

To remove the max Image size upload:

#if error comes in uploading file size image the use these : -1 make infinte size access.
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=-1
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=-1


//to save the current contact : we need to find the logged in user : using the principal ,
then find the userby username ,then save the current contact to that logged in user.

Check the data Saved to the Contact Table of Database in MSQL WorkBench

If error comes remove the toString method : Not in mine case.

Video 55 : Saving image of the Form

Save Image to a folder and only store the name in the database, but name of images should be unique

//First finding path to the static folder , then adding it.
    
            if(file.isEmpty())
            {
                System.out.println("File is empty");
            }
            else{
                //set the file to folder ,and put in contact field of image.
                
                contact.setImage(file.getOriginalFilename());
                
                
                File saveFile = new ClassPathResource("static/img").getFile();  
                Path path=Paths.get(saveFile.getAbsolutePath()+File.separator+file.getOriginalFilename());
                
                Files.copy(file.getInputStream(),path,StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);

Implemeting pagenation NEXT and PREVIOUS FUNCTIONS

Copy from bootstrap pagenation STEP 27 :
From handler / backend code send only the requeired fields.

Show dynamic page to the user Controller in showContacts handler.


Need to change the Repository method in the Contact Repository method. And implement the Page<Contact> code.

Use classappend to show teh highlighted current page.

To see the pagenation firer the user/show-contacts/0     : page no is must.

Give the 0 contact on the side bar

Setting profile Photo


Video 60 : Security bug of modification in url can be solved by the USING THE POST method , or by video method



Addin the image before name in show contact , and modify image in css file . aslo give defalut picture if not photo given.


But problem is that when we re run the project, images are deleted from the target folder.

Adding functionality to redirect to Profile of Contact via mail link

Desing handler to handler user/"id"/contact id to show the profile

_____________________________

VIDEO 61 : Removing bug random changing the url and see other users using hit and trial method /choose the POST METHOD Or allow this modification

Chech the current log in user, using the principal ,
 So that we can't access random contacts.


______________________________________

VIDEO 62 : DELETE buttom activation

Applying the delete functionality : change the button to <a> tag.

Also need to make handler , to handler the delete request.

TO delete the contact , we need to unlink it from the user , because during the mapping we have included the CascadeAll in One to  MAny mapping 

ALso chech in database , whethere the contact is actually deleted.


********** _______________________

ACTUALLY DELETEING THE CONTACTS (Here only user is delinking not the contacts are delteing)
*****

Since we have applied the cascade in @OneToMany Mapping so deleteof Repository is not funcional here

TO solve this SEE VIDEO 65 :

Add orphanRemoval =true;  // this menas that ,when the contact (child ) unlikns forn parent (User) its automatically removed.

Also overide the equals method, remvoe the current Contact from the user.






TO appply the sweet alert before deleting just google it , and copy the sript tag on show_contacts and add the code

Systax to use onclick delete dynamically

 th:onclick="|deleteContact(${c.cid} )|"

 Same fucntionality is added to delete button inside the main profile of Contact.

 Just take care of object is contact, so whiteLAbel Error is not come.


Also need to delete the image of current object from the img folder of target folder.

Put the code of script file in base.html in <script> tags .

 Video 63:  
 Update Option button :

Designing new from for update , learning purposes.

Need to user POst Mapping to secure manipulations form the url :

Also need to use the form tag , if used the used post mapping , <a> tag defalut uses get mapping as for delete fucntion

Just Copy the same form for the add, and provide the update form  :

Also fetch the values of data fields that are sent using the Model

To show the defalut value in text area use the th:text = ${contact.description}

________________________________


//  Video 64  : Updateing the form in the beckEnd , also handler the image

TO handler the problem arises on the updating is that user is not assigned , so not updated

So get the current user, and save the updated contact in it.


//Getting the old contact details and chech if new one is present or not.

// VIDEo 65 : Deleteing actually 


Similaary code to delete old photo , using the path and old id .

Look in dataBase ,and target folder for the changes.
